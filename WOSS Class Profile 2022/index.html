                From the lead filled water fountains to famous astronaut Chris Hadfield graduating from our school, White Oaks has a lot of originality to offer, 
                much of it thanks to the students present. Seeing debaters on team Canada and students that crush national math competitions in the hallways is not a rare sight.
                From our stellar band to the fact that we rank 21 out of 749 Ontario High Schools, it is obvious that White Oaks is special. In order to capture this amazing 
                group of people, we devised a survey to get to know more about this years graduates. We hope you enjoy!

        <div id="section2-result">
            <h3 id="section2-text">
                The most iconic convenience store near WOSS - lovingly named White Store - is a popular destination for students of all grades. The name originates from the 
                fact that ... the store is white (lol). From the 3 student limit inside, to the trampoline in the backyardThe real question is, who hasn't
                been there over the past 4 years? 
                <br>
                <br>
                Apparently, 3.3% of respondents (approximately X students) have not been to White Store even once, which is incredibly odd since every student hears about it 
                from the upper years. To these students, I ask: Why?
